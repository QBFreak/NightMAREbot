# NightMAREbot

NightMAREbot has been hanging around SluggyMARE in some form or other for over 15 years.
If you hadn't guessed from the name, he is a bot. Originally written in VB6 (or maybe even VB5), the current incarnation is built primarily out of TinyFugue scripts and Bash/Perl. Plus a healthy dose of TinyMARE softcode.
