		Notifications and messages exist to keep you abrest of what's happening on the
    		newsboard. Both have slightly different functions. %|11|Notifications%|0| are
    		sent to you when you log on, if there are unread posts or replies on the
    		newsboard. %|11|Messages%|0| on the other hand will be sent to you whenever a
    		new post (or reply) is made. Both of these can be controlled using preferences -
    		see help on %|11|Notify%|0| and %|11|Message%|0|.
